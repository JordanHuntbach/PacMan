# PacMan

This code is part of my dissertation for BSc Computer Science at Durham University (2019).

The project is to create an AI agent for Pac-Man, combining MCTS (Monte Carlo Tree Search) and a neural network, with the network having been evolved through NEAT (Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies).

The code here involves my copy of the game, as well as all of the AI.

## Development
```bash
./gradlew clean build
./gradlew run
```
