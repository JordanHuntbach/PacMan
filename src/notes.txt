I don't think the ghost release timers are implemented correctly during the sped-up play.
The ghosts also continue to move slowly in the simulations until they reach a junction. Need to increase their speed at
the start of each simulation.
Make the ghost hit-boxes smaller so they can't catch up to pac-man on corners.
