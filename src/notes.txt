Notes:
    After about 30 generations, each member is in its own species. Changed dt to 10, but then there was just 1 species. Try 5 next.
    Managed to get a high score of 2810 after 100 generations.

Things that need doing:
    Remove the animation timer from the main game loop.
    Remove all the if(simulation) stuff, except for the commented one that updates the screen, and add one that pauses the
        game for a bit if it's not a simulation.
    Fix the random ghost behaviour.
    Add inputs for the valid directions, and maybe current position.

Things to experiment with:
    Change the stagnation protocol to entire species altogether if they're not improving.
