Things that need doing:
    Fix the random ghost behaviour.
    After training, do something with the GUI.

Things to experiment with:
    Adding a negative reward when a ghost eats pacman.
    Adding a positive reward for exploration / survival.
    Change the stagnation protocol to entire species altogether if they're not improving.
    Incremental learning.



Go over all the MCTS code, and PAY ATTENTION. I'm convinced there is a bug, or else Pac-Man is suicidal.
There's a problem with the ghosts eating Pac-Man. I believe that when they do so and we aren't in a playout (still just
moving according to the tree structure), we don't backpropagate correctly. We don't update the tree to reflect that a
branch results in death.

Notes:
    After about 30 generations, each member is in its own species. Changed dt to 10, but then there was just 1 species. Try 5 next.
    Managed to get a high score of 2810 after 100 generations.
