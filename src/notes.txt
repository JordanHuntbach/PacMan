Things that need doing:
    After training, do something with the GUI.
    Make the levels different from each other.

Things to experiment with:
    Adding a negative reward when a ghost eats pacman.
    Adding a positive reward for exploration / survival.
    Change the stagnation protocol to entire species altogether if they're not improving.
    Incremental learning.

Notes:
    After about 30 generations, each member is in its own species. Changed dt to 10, but then there was just 1 species. Try 5 next.
    Managed to get a high score of 2810 after 100 generations.
